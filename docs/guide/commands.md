# Slash commands

Type `/` in the composer and the palette lists everything available in that
session. Commands are matched against the real list, so a message that merely
begins with a path — `/etc/hosts is wrong` — is still sent as a message.

The `/` is only how you type a command, and it can be another character: see
[The command character](#the-command-character). This page writes `/`
throughout.

The list is all of them — a lone `/` scrolls rather than stopping at the first
few — narrowing as you type, by prefix, and it is driven from the keyboard:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` `↓` | Move the highlight; it wraps |
| `Tab` | Complete the highlighted command, leaving the cursor after it for arguments |
| `Enter` | **Run** the highlighted command. `/cl` and Enter is `/clear`, not the message "/cl" |
| `Esc` | Put the list away until something else is typed |

A command typed out in full is the one highlighted, so `/skill:a` never runs
`/skill:ab` because that was listed first. A command that does nothing without
an argument — `/name` — is completed by Enter instead of run, so there is
somewhere to type the name.

A command that opens a dialog does not appear in the transcript. Its menu is the
feedback; a chat bubble saying `/models` would be noise.

## The command character

**Settings → This browser → Command character** sets what a command starts
with in the message box. It is `/` until you change it, and it can be any one
punctuation mark or symbol — `!`, `.`, `;`, `#`, `§` — but not a letter or a
digit, which would open the list for every message you write, nor `-`, `_` or
`:`, which are part of a command's own name.

With `!` chosen, typing `!` opens the same list, `Tab` completes `!skill:review`,
`Enter` runs the highlighted one, and the key that jumps to the message box from
anywhere on the page is `!` as well. That jump does not work for a dead key —
`^` on a German keyboard, for one — which the browser does not report as the
character it will type; such a character still starts a command typed in the
message box. A message that starts with `!` and is not one of the chat's
commands — `!important: the build is red` — is sent as it was written, as
`/etc/hosts is wrong` is under the slash.

pi is always sent the slash form. Whichever character you typed, `!skill:review
the diff` reaches the agent as `/skill:review the diff`, so skills, prompt
templates and every extension command keep working, and so do channels and
routines, which know nothing of this setting. That is also why the chat's own
line for a command, and the commands the agent suggests in a status line, still
show a `/`. A command typed out in full with the slash — `/compact` — still
runs as one after the character has been changed.

The choice is kept in this browser, like the theme and the keyboard shortcuts:
what is convenient to type depends on the keyboard (a German one reaches `/`
with Shift), and a phone may want another character than the laptop.

## Where they come from

| Source | Provided by |
| --- | --- |
| `builtin` | The portal |
| `extension` | An installed pi package |
| `prompt` | A prompt template |
| `skill` | A skill |

## Builtins

pi's builtin commands are implemented by whichever mode is running — the TUI
draws its own — so the portal supplies them. The names and descriptions are read
from the SDK's own `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`, so they track pi's releases rather
than drifting from a copy.

Only the ones the portal can actually service are offered. `/quit`, `/hotkeys`,
`/trust` and the auth commands are terminal concerns; listing them would be a
menu of things that quietly do nothing.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/compact` | Summarise the conversation to free context |
| `/session` | Model, effort, context, tokens, cost, tool calls |
| `/export` | Write the session out — HTML, or `.jsonl` if you name one |
| `/reload` | Reload extensions, skills, prompts and settings |
| `/model` | Open the model picker |
| `/settings` | Open settings |
| `/new` | Start a new chat in this project (Home, if that is where you are) |
| `/clear` | The same as `/new` |
| `/name` | Rename the session |

The first four act on the session server-side and report through the event
stream. The rest open portal UI and never reach pi.

`/compact` is not awaited — it is a model call, and holding the HTTP request
open for it would time out. It reports when it finishes.

## Extension commands

Anything an installed package registers appears automatically. Install
`pi-llama-cpp` and `/models` shows up, opening the same menu the TUI draws:

```
/models  [extension]  Browse Llama.cpp models
```

Interactive commands work because the portal binds a UI context when it creates
the session. Without one, pi hands the extension a default immediately and a
command that asks a question appears to do nothing. Dialogs are rendered as a
modal — select, confirm, input and editor are all supported.

Dialog events are deliberately never persisted. A stored one would be replayed
to every future reader, so reloading the page reopened a menu whose extension
had long since stopped waiting.

## Adding more

Install a pi package from [Settings → Extensions](/guide/extensions). Its
commands appear the next time the palette refreshes, which happens when a run
ends — no reload needed.
