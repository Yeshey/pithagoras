/**
 * The agent's memory, to look through: Understory's own read API, handed on.
 *
 * Understory's web UI reads a small JSON API at its root — the tree of the
 * bundle, one concept, a search, the log of changes, the graph of links, the
 * paths its queries took, whether the bundle is well-formed. Asked from here rather
 * than from the page: the address in mcp.json is where the portal reaches it,
 * which the browser may not (localhost, a Docker network, plain HTTP behind
 * an HTTPS portal), and the token stays on the server. Only these reads are
 * handed on; the few changes below go through Understory's own write path in
 * the container the portal runs, never through its HTTP API, which has none.
 *
 * It is not a documented API, so a failure says what Understory answered
 * rather than pretending the memory is empty.
