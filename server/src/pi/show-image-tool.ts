/**
 * Putting a picture in front of the person: a chart the agent drew, a
 * screenshot it saved, a photo it found.
 *
 * The agent has always been able to make pictures — it has a shell — but not
 * to show one: in voice mode there is nothing on the screen but the orb, and in
 * the chat a file name is all that appears. This names a picture in the chat's
 * folder; the page sees the call, and shows it (the picture window in voice
 * mode, a thumbnail under the tool line in the chat).
 *
 * Only the chat's folder, for the same reason the Files panel keeps to it: the
 * page fetches the picture back through /sessions/:id/picture, which serves
 * nothing outside it. A picture anywhere else is copied in first.
