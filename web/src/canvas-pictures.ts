 * Pictures from the chat's folder, in a canvas.

 * The agent writes `![chart](plots/chart.png)`: a path in the folder it works
 * in. As a URL that means nothing to the page, and the Markdown renderer
 * blocks a relative image outright, so each such path is turned into the
 * portal's address for that file before rendering. An address that is already
 * one — a web picture, a data: URL, one of the portal's own — is left alone.
 * A path outside the folder is left as written too: the server would refuse
 * it anyway, and this way it is not quietly sent somewhere else.
